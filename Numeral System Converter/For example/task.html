<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>If you don't know what's a numeral system, take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">Wikipedia</a>. Also, you can look at good series of videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSGS1uBSNQ&amp;list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjMH3mWf6kwqiTbT798eAOm&amp;index=29" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crSGS1uBSNQ&amp;list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjMH3mWf6kwqiTbT798eAOm&amp;index=29">here</a>. This video and some more next in this playlist are explaining various numeral systems and conversation between them.</p>

<p>Implement a program that outputs two numbers: the first number is decimal and the second one is binary. The numbers must be equal. You can choose a number you like.</p>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you output a single line,</li>
	<li>there are two numbers,</li>
	<li>the first number is decimal,</li>
	<li>the second number is binary (it starts with <code>0b</code> and contains only <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>),</li>
	<li>the first number is equal to the second one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that you do not need to enter anything into the program, you should print a line prepared in advance.<strong> </strong>A single String is expected to be printed.</p>
